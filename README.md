# pythonOdeSolver
A set of ODE solvers for python. Implements first order Euler and a range of higher-order methods. The goal of this implementation is to obtain a self-implemented version of the Fehlberg solver (RK4-5) with adaptive step size (Dormand Prince). This implementation is for training purposes only, in principle odeint from the scipy package should suit your needs.
